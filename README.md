### 👨‍💻 About the project:

- While doing my internship, they gave me a task to create a Whatsapp Link generator.
- The user will enter the whatsapp number (with country code) and the message they want to convey.
- When the user presses the "CREATE" button, a popup will generate.
- At the popup, the respective link will be generated in a textbox. Below the textbox, two buttons will be there.
- The first button is used to copy the link which is in the textbox.
- The second button is used to navigate the page to the link provided.
- Right below the two buttons, QR Code will also be generated.
- The QR Code will take you to the respective page when you scan from any other device.
